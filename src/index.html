			<h1>A Record Keeping App along the Path</h1>
			<p>
				I used to keep a record of my time spent on things while learning to
				programme and my other hobbies. This was in a paper journal which I used for
				a couple of years. Once I learned how to store data using
				<span>MongoDB</span> I decided to make essentially an online record keeper
				that allowed me to note where I spent my time.
				<br />
				<br />

				I decided to create "NoblePaths"; paths that were essential for every user
				and come pre-built with custom entry features for every user. These include
				a journal, gym, wake and food path. A real challenge was the gym path as
				this required data handling from 3 level nested arrays from the API which
				then needed to be put into state for rendering to the client.
				<br />
				<br />

				I like the 3D Mountain in the background with the cloud dome but want to
				make more with this.

				A Place To Upload and Share Jiu-Jitsu Match Videos <br />
				<br />
				(Video upload coming soon!)
			</h1>
			<p>
				I've found that many people I train Jiu-Jitsu with seperate their instagram
				accounts from personal and Jiu-Jitsu. Hence why a seperate video upload site
				came to mind.
				<br />
				<br />
				The main issue I'm stuck on at the moment is the server hosting. The backend
				video processing wouldn't work on my server platform so I decided to try and
				self host. I have a linux machine running NGINX as the server with
				port-forwarding on my home router. After linking to a NO-IP dynamically
				updating domain, I can land on my page but not configure NGINX to allow
				access once logged in.
